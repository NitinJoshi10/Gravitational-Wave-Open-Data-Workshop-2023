# Gravitational-Wave-Open-Data-Workshop-2023
The Open Data Workshop being conducted is part of a series that started in 2018. It serves as the 6th workshop in the series.
This workshop aims to provide participants with a crash-course in gravitational-wave data analysis. 
Throughout the workshop, I have attended lectures delivered by data analysis experts and gained hands-on experience through software tutorials.
Additionally, a data challenge was provided to test participants' newly acquired skills in gravitational-wave data analysis. In this repository, I am sharing my tutorial python files.
